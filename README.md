## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the solution for the **Elrics E-Commerce Billing &amp; Coupon Engine** technical assessment.

The application simulates a real-world e-commerce shopping workflow where users can browse products, manage a shopping cart, apply coupon codes, and place an order — with a fully rule-based billing engine that computes **discounts, GST, and shipping charges** in a strictly defined order.

The goal is to demonstrate clean architecture, modular code, robust business logic, graceful error handling, and a professional user interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Product Listing** — responsive product grid with image, name, category, price, stock and description
- **Shopping Cart** — add / update quantity / remove / clear, with live subtotal and item count
- **Coupon Engine** — validate and apply coupon codes (one active coupon at a time)
- **Billing Engine** — dynamic computation of discount → GST → shipping → final payable amount
- **Shipping Rules** — standard charge with free shipping above a configurable threshold
- **Order Placement** — cart validation, coupon re-validation, Order ID generation, confirmation screen
- **Validation** — explicit handling of all required edge cases (empty cart, invalid/expired coupons, stock limits, negative quantity, etc.)

## 🎟️ Coupon Rules

| Code          | Type             | Condition             | Benefit                          |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `WELCOME10`   | Percentage       | Min. purchase ₹1,000  | 10% off, capped at ₹500         |
| `FLAT500`     | Flat amount      | Min. purchase ₹5,000  | ₹500 off                         |
| `FESTIVAL20`  | Percentage       | Min. purchase ₹10,000 | 20% off, capped at ₹2,000        |
| `FREESHIP`    | Shipping         | —                     | Shipping charges become free     |
| `BUY2GET1`    | Buy 2 Get 1      | 3 eligible accessories| Cheapest eligible accessory free |

- Only **one coupon** can be active at a time.
- Invalid / expired / below-minimum coupons must show a clear validation message.
- Removing products after a coupon is applied **re-validates** the coupon.

## 🧮 Billing Calculation Order

The billing engine computes values in this **exact order**:

```text
Subtotal
   ↓
Coupon Discount
   ↓
GST / Tax
   ↓
Shipping Charges
   ↓
Final Payable Amount
```

The summary recomputes automatically whenever the cart, quantity, or coupon changes.

---

## ✅ Validation Requirements

The application must handle:

- [ ] Empty shopping cart
- [ ] Invalid coupon code
- [ ] Expired coupon
- [ ] Applying multiple coupons (only one allowed)
- [ ] Quantity exceeding available stock
- [ ] Negative quantity
- [ ] Duplicate products in the cart
- [ ] Removing products after coupon application
- [ ] Placing an order with an empty cart

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema (planned entities)

| Entity    | Key fields                                                          |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Product` | name, category, price, stock, image, description, isAccessory       |
| `Cart`    | items[] (product, quantity), updatedAt                              |
| `Coupon`  | code, type, value, minPurchase, maxDiscount, expiresAt, active      |
| `Order`   | orderId, items[], subtotal, discount, gst, shipping, total, coupon  |

---

## 📝 Assumptions

All assumptions made where the assessment left decisions open (to be updated as implementation proceeds):

1. **GST rate** — 18%, applied on `(Subtotal − Coupon Discount)`; shipping is not taxed.
2. **Shipping** — ₹49 standard fee; free above ₹999 order value (both configurable via `.env`).
3. **Coupon expiry** — every coupon record carries an `expiresAt` date; expired coupons are rejected with a message.
4. **BUY2GET1 eligibility** — products in the *Accessories* category are eligible; the cheapest of the three units is free (discount applied before GST).
5. **Duplicate cart entries** — adding an existing product increments its quantity instead of creating a duplicate line (standard cart behaviour).
6. **Stock** — placing an order decrements stock; quantity can never exceed available stock.
7. **Rounding** — all currency values are rounded to 2 decimal places at the final step.
8. **Free shipping** — applies when the post-discount amount is above ₹999.

## 🖥️ Frontend Notes

- Built with React (Vite). Logic is separated from UI:
  - `src/billing.js` – pure billing and coupon engine (no React, easy to unit test)
  - `src/data.js` – sample products (to be replaced by the `/api/products` call)
  - `src/App.jsx` – product grid, cart, coupon box, billing summary, order confirmation
- The bill is derived from cart + coupon on every render, so the summary always stays in sync.
- Applied coupons are re-validated whenever the cart changes and removed with a message if no longer valid.
- Order placement re-checks stock and the coupon before confirming.
- Currently runs on local sample data. The backend should repeat the same validation.
  
## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | /api/products | List products |
| POST | /api/billing/preview | Calculate the bill for a cart and coupon |
| POST | /api/billing/coupon | Validate a coupon |
| POST | /api/orders | Place an order (re-validates stock and coupon) |
| GET | /api/orders/:orderId | Fetch an order |

Request body for billing and orders: `{ "items": [{ "productId": "...", "quantity": 2 }], "couponCode": "WELCOME10" }`

**Setup:** in `backend/`, run `npm install`, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, run `npm run seed`, then `npm run dev`. Run tests with `npm test`.

## 🧠 Backend Notes

- `src/services/billing.js` is a pure billing and coupon engine (no database), covered by Jest tests.
- The server looks up prices from the database and never trusts prices sent by the browser.
- Orders re-validate the cart, stock and coupon, then decrement stock (with rollback if a line fails).
- The cart is kept in the browser, so there is no `Cart` collection.
  
## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 0** — Repository, README, project skeleton
- [x] **Phase 1** — Backend: models, migrations/seed, REST API
- [x] **Phase 2** — Billing & coupon engine with unit tests
- [x] **Phase 3** — Frontend: product grid, cart, coupon section, billing summary, order confirmation
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Validation polish, error states, responsive UI pass
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Final QA, README updates, submission
